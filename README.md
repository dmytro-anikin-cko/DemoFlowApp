# Android

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools and dependencies are installed:

- **Node.js**: Use Node.js 18.x LTS for compatibility. Avoid Node.js 20.x.
- **nvm**: To manage Node.js versions on macOS.
- **Java Runtime (JDK 17 or higher)**: React Native requires JDK 17 or higher for compatibility.
- **Android Studio**: Required for managing the Android SDK, emulators, and JDK.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSC)**: Used as the primary code editor for the React Native project.


## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1 Install Android Studio

1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) along with [Command Line tools](https://developer.android.com/studio) (scroll to the bottom of the page).
2. Open Android Studio and configure:
    - **Android SDK**: Install the required SDK tools (e.g., Build Tools, Platform Tools).
    - **Emulator**: Use the Device Manager to create and configure an Android Virtual Device (AVD).
    - **Android SDK Version**: You must ensure that Android API levels **34** and **35** are installed for compatibility with the Flow SDK.
        - Open **File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Android SDK**.
        - In the **SDK Platforms** tab:
            - Check if **Android 13** and **Android 14** are listed and installed.
            - If they are not, select them, and click **Apply** to download and install the missing SDKs.
        - In the **SDK Tools** tab:
            - Ensure that tools like **Android SDK Build-Tools**, **Android SDK Platform-Tools**, and **Android Emulator** are installed.

> Note: Open the full project in Visual Studio Code, but open the android folder separately in Android Studio for managing Android-specific tasks.
>


### 2.2 Install Node.js and Manage Versions

React Native recommends Node.js 18.x LTS. If you are on Node.js 20.x, downgrade to Node.js 18.x using `nvm`.

### Steps to Install and Configure `nvm`:

1. **Install `nvm`:**
    
    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
2. **Configure Shell for `nvm`:**
Reload the shell configuration:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
    
    If the `.zshrc` file doesn’t exist:
    
    - Create the file:
        
        ```bash
        touch ~/.zshrc
        ```
        
    - Add the following lines:
        
        ```bash
        export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # Loads nvm
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # Loads nvm bash_completion
        ```
        
    - Save and reload:
        
        ```bash
        source ~/.zshrc
        ```
        
3. **Install Node.js 18.x:**
    
    ```bash
    nvm install 18
    nvm use 18
    ```
    
4. **Verify Installation:**
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```
    

### 2.3 Configure the Java Runtime

React Native requires JDK 17 or higher. Ensure JDK 17 is installed and configured properly.

### Steps for macOS:

1. Install JDK 17:
    
    ```bash
    brew install openjdk@17
    ```
    
2. Link Java to the system:
    
    ```bash
    sudo ln -sfn $(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-17.jdk
    ```
    
3. Update `.zshrc`:
Add the following lines:
    
    ```bash
    export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```
    
4. Reload and verify:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    java -version
    ```
#### **Gradle JDK Configuration**

After setting up **JAVA_HOME**, ensure Android Studio uses the correct JDK for Gradle:


1. Open **File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle**.
2. Under **Gradle JDK**, select the option that corresponds to your system's **JAVA_HOME**. For example:
    
    ```
    JAVA_HOME Homebrew OpenJDK 17.0.13
    ```
    

Refer to the screenshot above for clarity. If the JDK version is incorrect or missing, make sure to configure your **JAVA_HOME** correctly in your `.zshrc` file and reload it.


### 2.4 Configure the Android SDK

To ensure the Android SDK is properly configured:

1. Add the following lines to `.zshrc`:
    
    ```bash
    export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
    export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH # Adds Android tools to the system PATH
    ```
    
2. Reload `.zshrc`:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
    
3. Verify SDK Installation:
    
    ```bash
    echo $ANDROID_HOME
    ls $ANDROID_HOME
    ```
    

### 2.5 Increase the System's File Limit (macOS)

To prevent Metro Bundler errors (e.g., `EMFILE: too many open files`):

1. Add the following line to `/etc/zshrc`:
    
    ```bash
    ulimit -n 8192
    ```
    
2. Reload the shell:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    
    ```

### 2.6. (EXTRA) Understanding the `.zshrc` File

<details>

<summary>Learn More</summary>

The `.zshrc` file is a shell configuration file for macOS. It contains environment variable declarations and commands that are executed every time you open a new terminal session. Below is the final configuration I used, with explanations:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" # Path to Node Version Manager (nvm)
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # Loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # Loads nvm bash completion scripts

export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17) # Path to Java 17 installation
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH # Adds Java 17 binaries to the system PATH

export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk # Path to the Android SDK
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH # Adds Android tools to the system PATH

ulimit -n 8192 # Increases the file descriptor limit to prevent Metro Bundler errors
```

</details>

### **2.7 (EXTRA) Understanding Gradle**

<details>

<summary>Learn More</summary>

Gradle is a powerful build system used for managing project dependencies and automating tasks in Android development. It plays a critical role in compiling, building, and running your React Native project on Android. Gradle handles the following key tasks:

### **Key Responsibilities of Gradle**

1. **Dependency Management**:
Gradle fetches and resolves all required libraries (e.g., Flow SDK, React Native dependencies) for the project from repositories like `mavenCentral()` and `google()`.
2. **Build Configuration**:
Gradle reads and applies the configuration defined in `build.gradle` and `gradle.properties` files, such as:
    - Minimum (`minSdkVersion`) and target (`targetSdkVersion`) Android versions.
    - Application ID, version code, and version name.
    - Additional configurations like enabling Hermes or Jetifier.
3. **Build Automation**:
Gradle automates the process of building APKs (Android application packages) by running tasks such as `assembleDebug`, `assembleRelease`, or custom tasks.
4. **Environment Management**:
Gradle ensures that the appropriate Java Development Kit (JDK) version and Android Build Tools are used during compilation.
5. **Integration with Android Studio**:
Gradle seamlessly integrates with Android Studio, allowing developers to:
    - Sync dependencies.
    - View and manage project structure.
    - Run tasks directly from the IDE.

---

### **Gradle Files in the Project**

1. **`settings.gradle`**:
    - Specifies the modules to include in the build process (e.g., `:app`).
    - Configures repositories where dependencies are resolved.
2. **`gradle.properties`**:
    - Contains global properties for the Gradle build system.
    - Examples: enabling Hermes, configuring JVM memory, or enabling AndroidX.
3. **`build.gradle`**:
    - **Project-level `build.gradle`**: Contains configurations shared across all modules, such as repository settings and Gradle plugin dependencies.
    - **Module-level `build.gradle` (e.g., `android/app/build.gradle`)**: Contains app-specific configurations like application ID, SDK versions, dependencies, and signing configurations.

---

### **Common Gradle Commands**

Here are some common Gradle commands and their purposes:

- **`./gradlew clean`**:
Cleans the build directory by removing all previously compiled files and build artifacts. This is useful when you encounter build errors or need to start fresh.
- **`./gradlew build`**:
Compiles the project, resolves dependencies, and packages the app into an APK or AAB (Android App Bundle).
- **`./gradlew assembleDebug`**:
Builds the debug version of the app. This is typically used for testing.
- **`./gradlew assembleRelease`**:
Builds the release version of the app, ready for deployment. Requires proper signing configuration.
- **`./gradlew dependencies`**:
Lists all dependencies for the project and their resolved versions.
- **`./gradlew tasks`**:
Lists all available Gradle tasks for the project.

---

### **Gradle Daemon and Hanging Processes**

Gradle uses a background process called the **Gradle Daemon** to speed up builds. However, sometimes the daemon can hang or cause issues. You can address this by:

- Stopping all Gradle processes:
    
    ```bash
    ./gradlew --stop
    ```
    
- Killing specific Gradle processes:
    
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep gradle
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```
    

### **Tips for Working with Gradle**

1. **Always Sync Gradle Files**:
Whenever you make changes to `build.gradle` or `gradle.properties`, use the **Elephant icon** in Android Studio to sync the Gradle files.
2. **Check Logs**:
If your build fails, inspect the logs in Android Studio or use `./gradlew build` in the terminal for detailed error messages.
3. **Configure Gradle JDK**:
Ensure the correct JDK version is set in Android Studio under **File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle**.
4. **Cache Issues**:
If you encounter dependency or build errors, clear the Gradle cache:
    
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean
    ```
    
5. **Use Gradle Wrapper**:
Always use `./gradlew` instead of `gradle` to ensure you’re using the Gradle version configured for the project.

## 3. Create a New React Native Project

### 3.1 Initialize the Project

Run the following command to create a pure React Native project (not Expo):

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli init DemoFlowApp
```

> Note: Avoid placing the project inside the AndroidStudioProjects folder. This can cause conflicts with the Metro bundler.
> 

### 3.2 Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd DemoFlowApp
```


## 4. Build and Run the Project

### 4.1 Start the Metro Bundler

Start the Metro bundler in one terminal:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

### 4.2 Launch the Emulator

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Go to **Tools > Device Manager** and start your AVD (Android Virtual Device).

### 4.3 Build and Run the App

In a separate terminal (zsh), run:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

> Note: Ensure the emulator is running before executing this command.
> 

### 4.4 (EXTRA) Understanding Metro

<details>
<summary>Learn More</summary>

Metro is the JavaScript bundler used by React Native. It processes your JavaScript code, bundles it into a format that your mobile app can understand, and serves it to the app via a development server.

### Key Features:

- **File Watching:** Metro continuously watches your JavaScript files for changes and updates the app in real-time during development.
- **Bundling:** It optimizes and bundles your JavaScript code for efficient app execution.
- **Error Reporting:** Provides real-time feedback on syntax or runtime errors during development.

### When to Use Metro:

- Start the Metro server whenever you work on the app by running:
    
    ```bash
    npx react-native start
    ```
    
- Ensure Metro is running in the background when building and testing your app.

### Common Metro Issues:

- **Too Many Open Files Error:**
    
    ```bash
    EMFILE: too many open files
    ```
    
    To resolve this, increase the system’s file limit (see Section 2.5).
    
- **Stale Cache:**
If Metro serves outdated files, reset its cache with:
    
    ```bash
    npx react-native start --reset-cache
    ```
    

Metro is a critical part of the React Native development process. Ensuring it runs smoothly will save time and help avoid unexpected issues.

</details>

## 5. Verify Setup

At this stage, you should see React Native welcome page on your emulator! If not, run the following command to ensure your environment is configured correctly:

```bash
npx react-native doctor
```
> Use the same terminal from step 4.3
>

Resolve any reported issues, such as missing Android SDK components or incompatible Java versions.

### 5.1 (EXTRA) Troubleshooting Common Issues

<details>
<summary>Learn More</summary>

#### Gradle Sync Errors

If you encounter errors related to Gradle or dependencies during the project setup, sync the Gradle files in Android Studio. This step is not required during project initialization but may be necessary when adding the Flow SDK.

#### Debugging Metro Bundler Errors

If the Metro Bundler throws `EMFILE: too many open files`, rebuild the bundler and reset the cache:

```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```
In case it doesn't work, you might need to reinstall the node_modules folder. Do this by running:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```
</details>

## 6. Integrating the Flow SDK and Configuring the Project

This section outlines the steps to integrate Checkout.com's Flow SDK into the React Native project, including Gradle configurations, Kotlin files, and troubleshooting common issues during the integration process.

### 6.1 Update Gradle Files

To integrate the Flow SDK, the following changes were made to the Gradle files:

#### `android/settings.gradle`

This file ensures the required repositories and plugins are included for resolving dependencies.

**Key Changes:**

- Added `mavenCentral()` to the `repositories` block to fetch the Flow SDK and other dependencies.
- Included the `react-native-gradle-plugin`.

---

#### `android/gradle.properties`

This file contains project-wide Gradle settings.

**Key Additions and Their Purpose:**

- `hermesEnabled=true`: Enables Hermes, React Native’s JavaScript engine, for better performance.
- `android.useAndroidX=true` and `android.enableJetifier=true`: Ensures compatibility with AndroidX libraries.
- `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m`: Increases Gradle's memory allocation to avoid build failures.

---

#### `android/build.gradle`

This file configures project-level Gradle settings.

**Key Changes:**

- Added `mavenCentral()` to the `repositories` block.
- Specified Kotlin and Gradle plugin versions compatible with the Flow SDK.

---

#### `android/app/build.gradle`

This file configures app-level Gradle settings.

**Key Additions and Their Purpose:**

- Added the Flow SDK dependency: `implementation("com.checkout:checkout-android-components:1.0.0-beta-1")`.
- Defined `FLOW_API_KEY` in `buildConfigField` for secure API key management.

#### Sync Gradle Files
After making changes to the Gradle files, it’s essential to sync them in Android Studio to ensure the configurations are applied correctly.

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Locate the Elephant icon in the top toolbar.
3. Click on it to sync your Gradle files with the project.

This step will fetch dependencies and apply the updated configurations. Any issues with the Gradle sync will be displayed in the Build output.

> Note: Ensure all Android SDK dependencies (e.g., Build Tools, Platform Tools) are installed as per Section 2.1 if the sync fails.
> 

### 6.2 Add Native Modules & Bridge

#### `FlowModule.kt`

The `FlowModule.kt` file bridges React Native's JavaScript with the Flow SDK.

**Thing to note:**
1. The following imports are required for proper integration of the Flow SDK. Missing these can lead to `Unresolved reference` errors.

```kotlin
import com.checkout.components.core.CheckoutComponentsFactory
import com.checkout.components.interfaces.Environment
import com.checkout.components.interfaces.component.CheckoutComponentConfiguration
import com.checkout.components.interfaces.error.CheckoutError
import com.checkout.components.interfaces.model.ComponentName
import com.checkout.components.interfaces.model.PaymentSessionResponse
import com.checkout.components.interfaces.api.CheckoutComponents
import com.checkout.components.interfaces.component.ComponentCallback
```

2. In the official documentation, the method `checkoutComponent.provideCheckoutComponentsLayout(containerView)` is suggested for rendering. However, this method is a typo. Use the following method instead:

```kotlin
val view = flowComponent.provideView(containerView)
```

---

#### `FlowPackage.kt`

The `FlowPackage.kt` file plays a critical role in making the native `FlowModule` accessible from JavaScript. It acts as a bridge initializer by registering the `FlowModule` with React Native.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Register Native Modules**: It ensures `FlowModule` is exposed to React Native and can be accessed via `NativeModules.FlowModule` in JavaScript.
2. **Bridge Initialization**: Ensures smooth communication between JavaScript and native code.

---

#### Adding `FlowPackage` to MainApplication.kt

After creating `FlowPackage.kt`, we must register it in **MainApplication.kt**. This step connects the package to React Native's runtime, making the module available to the app.

**Steps to Add `FlowPackage`:**

1. Open `MainApplication.kt`.
2. Locate the `getPackages()` method.
3. Add the following line to include `FlowPackage`:

```kotlin
packages.add(FlowPackage())
```

---

### **Summary of the Bridging Process**

1. **`FlowModule.kt`**: Defines the native functionality and exposes it to JavaScript.
2. **`FlowPackage.kt`**: Registers `FlowModule` with React Native.
3. **MainApplication.kt**: Connects `FlowPackage` to React Native's runtime to make it available in the app.

By completing these steps, the native module `FlowModule` is fully integrated and ready to be accessed from JavaScript.

---

### Rebuild the Project
Once you’ve created and registered the native modules, it’s essential to rebuild your project to incorporate the changes. Follow these steps:

1. Clean the Gradle build cache:
```bash
./gradlew clean
```
This command removes all previously compiled files and build artifacts, ensuring a fresh build.

2. Build the project using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew build
```
This resolves dependencies and compiles the project.

3. Rebuild and launch the app:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```
Note: If any errors occur during the ./gradlew build process, check the logs in the terminal or Android Studio's Build Output tab to diagnose the issue. Always ensure your dependencies are synced (see Section 6.1) before proceeding.

### 6.3 (EXTRA) Common Issues and Resolutions

<details>
<summary>Learn More</summary>

- **Hanging Gradle Processes:**
Use `ps aux | grep gradle` to find Gradle processes and `kill -9 <PID>` to terminate them.
- **Cache Issues:**
Use the following commands to clear caches and rebuild the project:
    
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean  # Clears build artifacts
    ./gradlew build  # Compiles the project and verifies dependencies
    ```
    
- **Lock File Issues:**
Remove lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`) and reinstall dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```
    
- **Metro Bundler Issues:**
Reset the Metro bundler cache to resolve issues with stale files:
    
    ```bash
    npx react-native start --reset-cache
    ```
- **Gradle Sync Required:** After verifying or installing the necessary Android SDK versions, always sync the Gradle files in Android Studio. Click on the **Elephant icon** in the top toolbar to ensure the project is properly synchronized.

# iOS

## **1. Verify Your iOS Development Environment**

Before integrating the Checkout iOS SDK, ensure your environment is properly set up. Run: npx react-native doctor

In my case, the output reported: 

✖ Xcode - Required for building and installing your app on iOS

- Version found: N/A
- Version supported: >= 12.x
✓ Ruby - Required for installing iOS dependencies
✖ CocoaPods - Required for installing iOS dependencies
- Version found: N/A
- Version supported: >= 1.10.0
● ios-deploy - Required for installing your app on a physical device with the CLI
✓ .xcode.env - File to customize Xcode environment

## 1.1 Install Xcod

Since `npx react-native doctor` reported `✖ Xcode - Required for building and installing your app on iOS`, we need to check if Xcode is installed and properly set up.

1. If you haven’t installed Xcode, install it through [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or CKO Self Service Portal.
2. Run this command in the terminal to c**heck if Xcode is installed**
    
    ```bash
    xcode-select -p
    ```
    
    - If it outputs a valid path (e.g., `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`), Xcode is installed.
    - In my case, the output was /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools, which means **only the Command Line Tools** are installed, but not the full **Xcode IDE**. We need to switch it to the full Xcode IDE.
        - Run this command to set the correct Xcode path:
            
            ```bash
            sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
            ```
            
        - Run xcode-select -p again to verify the change. The output should now be: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
        - Run npx react-native doctor to check if Xcode is now recognized by React Native

### **1.2 Install CocoaPods**

The doctor output also showed `✖ CocoaPods - Required for installing iOS dependencies`.

1. Install CocoaPods using Homebrew:
    
    ```bash
    brew install cocoapods
    ```
    
2. Verify the installation:
    
    ```bash
    pod --version
    ```
    
    - If the version is `>= 1.10.0`, you're good to go.
3. **After Installing CocoaPods**
    
    Since you're using an **existing React Native project**, navigate to the `ios/` folder inside your project and install dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/react-native-project/ios
    pod install
    ```
    
    > Important: Always run pod install inside the ios/ folder after adding iOS dependencies.
    > 
4. Once CocoaPods is installed and `pod install` is successful, run:
    
    ```bash
    npx react-native doctor
    ```
    

If everything looks good, you can move on to adding the **Checkout iOS SDK**! 🚀

## 2. Add the Checkout iOS SDK

### **2.1 Open the iOS Project in Xcode**

1. Navigate to the `ios` folder inside your React Native project.
    
    ```bash
    cd ios
    ```
    
2. Open the project workspace in Xcode:
    
    ```bash
    open YourProjectName.xcworkspace
    ```
    
    - If the `.xcworkspace` file doesn't exist, run:
        
        ```bash
        pod install
        ```
        

### **2.2 Add the Checkout SDK via Swift Package Manager (SPM)**

1. In Xcode, select your project from the left sidebar.
2. Go to **Project > Package Dependencies**.
3. Click the **+** button.
4. In the URL field, enter:
    
    ```
    https://github.com/checkout/checkout-ios-components
    ```
    
5. Set **Dependency Rule** to **Up to Exact Version and input: 1.0.0-beta-3 (this is the latest version at the moment)**
6. Set Add to Project to YourProjectName
7. Click **Add Package**.
8. Verify installation:
    1. In the left panel, under Package dependencies section, you should see CheckoutComponents 
    2. In the left panel, click on the first YourProjectName, then go to Project>YourProjectName, under Package Dependencies tab, you should see checkout-ios-components listed
    3. In the left panel, click on the first YourProjectName, then go to Targets>YourProjectName, in the Link Binary with Libraries section, you should see CheckoutComponents. If not, add it by clicking on the plus icon, and searching for it.

If everything looks good, you can proceed with 3. **Initializing CheckoutComponents** in your project.

## 3. **Creating the Bridge for Flow SDK**

React Native projects use Objective-C/Objective-C++ for their iOS entry point (`AppDelegate.h` and `AppDelegate.mm`), while the Checkout Flow SDK is built with Swift. This creates a bridging challenge that requires two distinct bridges:

1. **Swift to Objective-C Bridge**: Since the iOS Flow SDK uses Swift but React Native uses Objective-C for native modules, we first need to make Swift code accessible to Objective-C.
2. **Objective-C to JavaScript Bridge**: Then we need to expose our Objective-C interface to JavaScript so React Native can access it.

The complete flow for a method call goes:

- JavaScript (React Native) →
- Objective-C (React Native bridge) →
- Swift (CheckoutFlowManager) →
- Checkout Flow SDK

Let's set up these bridges step by step:

### **3.1 Add Swift Support to the Project**

### **Step 1: Add a Swift Bridging Header**

1. In Xcode, right-click on your project folder (e.g., `YourProjectName`) and select **New File...**
2. Choose **Swift File** and name it `Dummy.swift`
3. When prompted "Would you like to configure an Objective-C bridging header?", click **Create Bridging Header**
4. This will create:
    - A `Dummy.swift` file (can be empty)
    - A `YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h` file

### **Step 2: Update the Bridging Header**

Open your bridging header file (`YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h`) and add:

```objectivec
//
//  Use this file to import your target's public headers that you would like to expose to Swift.
//
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>
#import <React/RCTUtils.h>
#import <React/RCTConvert.h>

```

### **3.2 Create the CheckoutFlowManager Swift Module**

Create a new Swift file named `CheckoutFlowManager.swift`:

1. Right-click on your project folder in Xcode
2. Select **New File...**
3. Choose **Swift File**
4. Name it `CheckoutFlowManager.swift`
5. Copy and paste the code from `CheckoutFlowManager.swift`

> Important: Remmeber to use your own Checkout.com public key.
> 

### **3.3 Create the Objective-C Bridge**

Create a new Objective-C file to expose your Swift module to React Native:

1. Right-click on your project folder and select **New File...**
2. Choose **Objective-C File**
3. Name it `CheckoutFlowManagerBridge.m`
4. Add the following code:

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(CheckoutFlowManager, NSObject)

// Declare methods exposed to JavaScript with promise support
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(initialize:(NSDictionary *)paymentSession
                  resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(renderFlow:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

// Optional test method
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(test:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                 rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

@end

```

### **3.4 Update AppDelegate.mm**

In your `AppDelegate.mm` file, add the import for your Swift code and ensure the module name is properly registered:

```objectivec
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
#import "React/RCTBridgeModule.h"
#import "React/RCTBridge.h"
#import "YourProjectName-Swift.h" // Replace YourProjectName with your actual project name

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  self.moduleName = @"YourProjectName"; // Must match your React Native project name
  // You can add your custom initial props in the dictionary below.
  // They will be passed down to the ViewController used by React Native.
  self.initialProps = @{};
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

- (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge
{
  return [self bundleURL];
}

- (NSURL *)bundleURL
{
#if DEBUG
  return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index"];
#else
  return [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
#endif
}

@end

```

> Important:
> 
> 1. Replace `YourProjectName-Swift.h` with your actual project name
> 2. Ensure `self.moduleName = @"YourProjectName";` matches your React Native project name
> 3. Do not modify the rest of the AppDelegate template code unless you know what you're doing

## 3.5 (EXTRA) Files Overview

<details>

<summary>Learn More</summary>

Here's a comprehensive table of all files involved in the iOS Flow SDK integration:

| File | Format | Purpose | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AppDelegate.h** | Objective-C Header | App Entry Point Declaration | Contains the declaration of the AppDelegate class which is the entry point for your iOS app. You typically don't need to modify this file. |
| **AppDelegate.mm** | Objective-C++ | App Entry Point Implementation | Contains the implementation of your app's entry point. You need to import your Swift header file here and ensure module name registration. |
| **YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h** | C Header | Swift-to-Objective-C Bridge | Allows your Swift code to use Objective-C code. Contains imports for React Native bridge modules. |
| **Dummy.swift** | Swift | Enable Swift in the Project | An empty Swift file that triggers Xcode to set up Swift support for your Objective-C project. Can be empty but must exist. |
| **CheckoutFlowManager.swift** | Swift | SDK Wrapper | Implements the interface between React Native and the Checkout.com Flow SDK. Contains methods for initializing and rendering the payment flow. |
| **CheckoutFlowManagerBridge.m** | Objective-C | JavaScript-to-Swift Bridge | Exposes your Swift methods to JavaScript using the React Native bridge macros. Declares which methods from your Swift file will be available in JavaScript. |
| **App.tsx** (or your payment component) | TypeScript/JavaScript | React Native UI | Implements the React Native UI that calls your native module methods. Contains platform-specific code to handle both iOS and Android. |

### File Relationships and Data Flow

1. **JavaScript to Native:**
    - Your React Native code (`App.tsx`) calls methods on `NativeModules.CheckoutFlowManager`
    - React Native bridge processes these calls through `CheckoutFlowManagerBridge.m`
    - The bridge invokes methods on your Swift `CheckoutFlowManager` class
2. **Swift to SDK:**
    - `CheckoutFlowManager.swift` interacts with the Checkout.com SDK
    - It initializes the SDK and renders the payment UI
    - Results from the SDK are passed back through promises
3. **Project Setup:**
    - `AppDelegate.mm` is the iOS app entry point that registers your React Native module
    - `YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h` makes React Native's Objective-C code available to Swift
    - `Dummy.swift` ensures Swift runtime is included in your Objective-C project

</details>

## 4. **Using the Flow SDK in React Native**

Now that the bridge is set up, it's time to use it in your React Native code.

### **4.1 Accessing the Native Module**

Update your `App.tsx` or create a new component for handling payments. Copy and paste the code from `App.tsx`.


## 5. Build and Test Your Integration

### **5.1 Final Steps and Verification**

1. **Clean your project**: In Xcode, go to **Product > Clean Build Folder**
2. **Restart Metro**: Kill the current Metro server and restart with a clean cache:
    
    ```bash
    npx react-native start --reset-cache
    
    ```
    
3. **Run the app on iOS simulator**:
    
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-ios
    
    ```
    

### **5.2 (EXTRA) Troubleshooting Tips**

<details>

<summary>Learn More</summary>

If you encounter any issues during the integration or at runtime, try these troubleshooting steps:

### Module Not Found or App Crashing

1. **Check module registration**:
    - Ensure the module name matches exactly in Swift and JavaScript
    - Verify your bridging header has the correct imports
    - Check that `YourProjectName-Swift.h` is correctly named in AppDelegate.mm
2. **Verify Swift version compatibility**:
    - In Xcode, go to **Build Settings > Swift Compiler - Language**
    - Ensure Swift language version is compatible with the SDK
3. **Add more logging**:
    - Add `console.log()` statements in JavaScript to track execution
    - Add `print()` statements in Swift to track native code execution
4. **Test with a simplified version**:
    - Create a simple test method in your Swift module
    - Call it from React Native to verify basic communication works
5. **Check Xcode and Metro logs**:
    - Xcode console will show Swift/Objective-C errors
    - Metro console will show JavaScript errors
